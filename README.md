# Hardware Neural Logic

--------

Implementing basic neural network on an arduino using cylon.js. Although this may be an overkill for the whole process, it also serves as a learning project for cylon.js

---------

Notes:

Cylon.JS will handle the computation and processing, the arduino will only serve as the output for the project. No arduino codes will be used
